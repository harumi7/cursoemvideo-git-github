                <h2>Branch</h2>
                <p>In a project, different branches are used to work on specific tasks, such as features, design, and content.</p>
                <p>It works like a tree with many branches! Once a branch is complete, you can merge it into the master (main) branch.</p>

                <h2>Fork</h2>
                <p>A "fork" on GitHub is a copy of a repository that allows you to make changes to the code without affecting the original repository. It's very useful for collaboration and open-source projects development.</p>

                <h2>Issue</h2>
                <p>On GitHub, an "issue" is a tool for tracking tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. Issues can be used to discuss and plan new features, report problems, and track the progress of different parts of a project.</p>

                <h2>Pull request</h2>
                <p>A "pull request" is a feature on GitHub that allows you to notify others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the main branch.</p>
